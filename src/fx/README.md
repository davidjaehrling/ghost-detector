Visual effects. `ghostV0/` is the P2 ghost compositor, built on plain RN `Image` and `View`
so it runs before Skia lands. P3 swaps the internals; the props stay.

## ghostV0: what it does
- `regionFromImage(uri)` -> `{ region, meanLuma, p90Luma } | null`. Both platforms end in
  `regionFromRgba` (`regionFromPixels.ts`): `downsampleLuma` to 96 px, `findDarkRegion`, then the
  region box's mean and 90th-percentile luma.
  - Web (`regionFromImage.web.ts`): canvas `getImageData` at 384 px.
  - Native (`regionFromImage.ts`): `expo-image-manipulator` resizes to 96 px on the long side and
    saves a base64 JPEG; `jpeg-js` decodes it in JS (`regionFromJpegBase64`). No Skia. Needs a dev
    client build that includes `expo-image-manipulator`.
- `placeGhost(region | null, frame, seed, { opacityRange? })` -> `Placement`. Pure, seeded, tested.
  Figure plus motion copies cover at most 15% of the frame, centre 10 to 30% of the region size
  off the centroid and inside the region box, never within 8% of the frame midline, opacity
  0.08 to 0.25, 3 to 5 offset copies along one drift direction at falling alpha. No region:
  lower third, left or right of the midline.
- `<GhostV0 placement regionMeanLuma />` draws the matte copies inside one absolute-fill layer
  over the photo. Optional props: `fadeInMs` (linear `Animated.timing` 0 to 1, default 0 = final
  state at once; `?static=1` on web always shows the final state), `regionP90Luma` (tint fallback
  only), `disabled`, `blend` (`'screen' | 'tint'`).
- Mattes: `assets/ghost/matte-{1,2,3}.png` from `scripts/gen-ghost-mattes.mjs` (seeded, no source
  images). Alpha is normalised so the densest 2% of each matte is fully opaque, eased
  (`1 - (1 - a)^3.2`) so the drape fills while the edge stays soft, and the figure is cropped to its
  box (at most 1.3x stretch per axis). A second, finer noise field warps and bites the head so it
  never reads as a round blob.

## Blend: the ghost adds light
The layer has `mixBlendMode: 'screen'`; the copies stack with normal alpha inside it. Screen gives
`out = b + A * s * (255 - b) / 255` (backdrop `b`, layer alpha `A`, matte grey `s` = 255), so it
can only lift, most over black and least over near-white, which is how light in a photo behaves.
- Native: RN 0.77+ on the new architecture supports `mixBlendMode` on views.
- Web: react-native-web 0.21 passes `mixBlendMode` through as CSS `mix-blend-mode`. It sits on the
  layer, not on the images, because every RN web view is its own stacking context (`z-index: 0`):
  a blend on an image would only mix with the empty layer.
- Fallback (`blend="tint"`, or web without `CSS.supports('mix-blend-mode', 'screen')`): normal
  alpha with a neutral grey at `p90 + 18` (`ghostTint`, `FALLBACK_LIFT`), so the figure lifts the
  region's brighter pixels too. Weaker: pixels brighter than the tint still darken. Without
  `regionP90Luma` it estimates p90 as mean + 30.

## Alpha cap (Refuter D4)
Copies share a fixed budget: their alpha multipliers sum to `COPY_ALPHA_SUM` = 0.35, falling by
0.72 per step. Where the figure and every copy overlap, the layer alpha is
`1 - (1 - o) * prod(1 - o * a_i) <= o * (1 + sum a_i) = 1.35 o <= 1.35 * 0.25 = 0.3375`
(union bound; `stackedAlpha` computes the exact value, tested for 2000 placements).

## L2 harness flags (web only, read inside `GhostV0`)
- `?ghost=0` hides the ghost (with/without difference images).
- `?ghostblend=tint` forces the fallback path.

## Measured (L2, Chromium, 390x844 at 1x, `fixture=cellar`, `static=1`)
Screenshot of the photo panel with and without the ghost, luma difference:

| demo | matte, opacity | mean lift in figure box | max lift | darkened px | lifted px (>= 2) of panel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| active | 3, 0.174 | 12.9 | 58 | 0 | 10.7% |
| critical | 1, 0.090 | 9.1 | 31 | 0 | 10.5% |

The union box of figure plus copies is 25% / 23% of the visible panel: the area cap is applied
to the full 3:4 photo frame passed to `placeGhost`, and the result screen crops it to a shorter
panel. Pass the visible panel as `frame` to cap against what is seen.

## Stable contract (P3 keeps these)
- `placeGhost` signature and the `Placement` shape (pixels in the photo view's space).
- `<GhostV0 placement regionMeanLuma />` required props; P3 may add optional ones (a `photo`
  for the grain pass) but must not require new ones.
- `regionFromImage(uri): Promise<{ region, meanLuma, p90Luma } | null>`.

## What P3 replaces
- RN `mixBlendMode` -> Skia Screen or Plus blend mode.
- Offset copies -> real Gaussian blur on the ghost (more than the scene) plus directional blur.
- Baked noise in the matte -> live FractalNoise mask for feathering, displacement per photo.
- No grain today -> one grain pass applied after compositing, over photo and ghost together.
- JPEG round trip in `regionFromImage` -> Skia raster image read back on the device.
